	<h2><strong><br>From Humble Beginnings to.......</strong></h2>

	<p> 
		...a self-taught average software programmer. We had all but one class asynchronous! Nothing made sense in the beginning...<em>and</em>
	 or <em>or</em>?<br>
	 <em>while</em> loop or a <em>for</em> loop? What were they? How to even differentitate between such logic? While my head was being busy dissecting<br> these logics, the <em>supply and demand factors</em> were battering my head against a thick, wooden door! What was the cherry on top you ask?<br> A regular, 40-hours full-time job! 

	 But we all knew, the moment we stepped foot onto the mud, we weren't leaving until we got our clothes <br>dirty!
	 This was in Fall of 2019. Back when we were still new into the states and hated everything here! Missing my friends back home, the<br> memories, the bond... What killed it even more was the fact of having to wait 2 years minimum before enrolling at a community college.<br> Ofcourse one could enroll the day they step into U.S., but goodluck paying 2-3 times the amount as an international student.

	 <br>Well, my first high-level programming level was <em>Python 3.x</em>We were taught the generics of programming but had to code in that language.<br>For example, the book; <em>Logic Structres and ALgorithm Design</em>, covered how to devise an alogorithm, what they were along with generics of <br> flowchart designs. These were just the blueprints of a program, the real deal was the source code which we had to write in python. Stuff slowly <br> started making sense once we devoted our time in gathering information from various sources (thank you Youtube!), just as I am doing now for <br>this web development
	 language right now! <br>
