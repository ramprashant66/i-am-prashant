            <h2 class="first">1. Who am I?</h2>
            <p>You can check out all my biographic information <a href="../bio/bio.html" class="links">here.</a></a></p>

            <h2>2. Why did I create this webpage?</h2>
            <p>It was my winter break and I wanted to learn web development in my spare time so this was the golden
                opportunity...Plus, this can also be used as an online portfolio for my potential employers...Wouldn't
                that just be great? ;)</p>

            <h2>3. Is this webpage safe to browse? </h2>
            <p>Mmhmmm. My website's data traffic is encrypted with SSL certificate which not only encrypts the web
                traffic but also acts as an authentication signature that this is a legitamate website with a registered
                domain and the owner's identity verified.</p>

            <h2>3. What is the site for anyways? </h2>
            <p>To prepare ourselves for the zombie acopolypse, what else?! Nah, I'm just kidding..Well, there's nothing
                going on here on the site. Just a young dev, learning the outskirts of web development and trying to
                implement it as a real project.</p>
