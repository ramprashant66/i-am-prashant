			<h1><em class="question">So, you wanna know a little about me, huh?</em></h1>
			<img src="../images/spongebob.png" alt="spongebob-heading-out" class="memes">
			<h3>Real talk though, who is the developer of this webpage?</h3>
			<p>It is I, Prashant. Ram. You know, Prashant.Ram! No? Never heard of me?</p>
			<img src="../images/out.png" alt="grumpy" class="memes">
			<h3>What is my academic background, you ask?</h3>
			<p>Well, in high school, I was a pure science student. I took foundational sciences to dive deeper into;
				chemistry, biology, mathematics and communication
				studies at our national university. After that was complete, I spent 3 years persuing veterinary science
				and animal
				husbandry under the same
				university until my family and I emigrated to the U.S. While here, I got enrolled at a community
				college and took a few of the programming classes until I had met the requirements for my transfer to a
				university.
			</p>
			<h3>How are our plans for the future?</h3>
			<p>Well, I am getting ready to transfer to a University here to persue a bachelors degree in eiher Computer
				Enginnering, or Computer Science. I will declare my major after I get in.
			</p>
			<h3>My age?</h3>
			<p>Yes, I mean, 26.</p>
			<h3>What were some of your personal projects, so far?</h3>
			<p>Have you heard of the app, "turnitin" which is used by majority of the academic institutions? Yeah, I
				wasn't a part of that.

				But real talk, this would be my first ever personal project. I have made; tictactoe game in C++ (human
				vs computer),
				a XOR cipher in x86 assembly, etc., but, these were mostly done as assignments. This however, is how I
				spent my winter break. I learnt HTML, CSS and Bootstrap on my own to be able to create these pages. It's
				a work in progress but hey, we're learning and improving.
			</p>
			<h3>How do I spend most of my time?</h3>
			<p>Because there's so much information in the field of I.T., I spend most of time either reading articles on
				cybersecurity, Linux CLI, ways of making my codes more efficient, etc. I am not a nerd, please..</p>
